    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

    <p>Diaa Guedouari is committed to not collecting personally identifiable or sensitive information about you. We do not ask for your full name, email address, phone number or other personally identifiable as part of gameplay. The application does collect some non-sensitive, anonymous data as outlined below:

    <h2>Data collected for Analytics (iOS and Android)</h2>

    <p>We have implemented Analytics tools to help us understand how the application is being used and for the purposes of improving this, or other games published by Diaa Guedouari. For example we use Google Analytics which keep track of how many players have beaten each level of the game, made an in-app purchase, device type, operating system and country of access.Data collected for Advertising</p>
    <p>Because our games on Android stores (Google Play & the Amazon Appstore) and iOS store is free-to-play, we periodically display in-game advertising by third parties to generate revenue.</p>

    <p>In order to display relevant advertising (also known as interest based advertising) and measure performance of advertising campaigns we have implemented several ad-network SDK within the game which collect and transfer non-sensitive device information including:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>The advertisement you have viewed and if you have engaged with it</li>
        <li>Device make and manufacturer</li>
        <li>Operating System</li>
        <li>Generic geographic location, such as the city you are located in</li>
        <li>Carrier</li>
        <li>Language settings</li>
        <li>IP Address</li>
        <li>Android Advertising identifier</li>
    </ul>

    <h1>Opt Out</h1>

    <p>By playing our games you are consenting to the above collection of anonymous, non-sensitive data as outlined in this privacy policy.If you would like to opt-out of interest based advertising or collection of data for analytics, or find out more information of any Analytics or Ad network products implemented within our games please contact us by email: at diaaelhakguedouari (at) gmail (dot) com</p>

    <h1>Why collect data?</h1>
    <p>By collecting data on app usage and about your device and location, we are better able to integrate updates, implement device specific testing, explore localization opportunities and make better games that are tailored to our userâ€™s needs.When we offer our games as free-to-play, we still require the game to generate income to help fund development costs and efforts to make the best game possible. Advertising is one way we can help cover our costs, and in order to implement relevant advertising a certain amount of non-sensitive information is required by each ad network.</p>
